# About Me


Here is **Jingqiang Ye (Âè∂ÈùñÂº∫)**.

I am an experimental particle physicist. My main research interests include the direct detection of dark matter, neutrinos, and axions using noble liquid detectors and the development of technologies for next-generation detectors. Our group is involved with the XENONnT dark matter experiment and RELICS reactor neutrino experiment, and I served as Analysis Coordinator for the XENONnT experiment from 2022 to 2023.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, you can feel free to contact me. please email me at *yejingqiang@cuhk.edu.cn*.
