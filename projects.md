## XENONnT Dark Matter Experiment

The XENONnT experiment, located in Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), Italy, is primarily designed to search for the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), one of the most popular dark matter candidates. As the latest in the XENON-series experiments, XENONnT is one of the most sensitive dark matter detectors similar to its predecessors in their eras. Benefitting from its large active mass and the unprecedented low background, the XENONnT experiment has placed a stringent limit on the cross-section between dark matter and nucleons [1], as well as constraints on other new physics including axions and neutrino magnetic moment [2]. In 2022, XENONnT deciphered a mysterious excess ([link](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/xenons-experimental-triumph-no-dark-matter-but-the-best-null-result-in-history-464b1a30a2f)), which was observed by XENON1T in 2020 and puzzled both theorists and experimentalists in the field, with only the first three month data [2]. As you are reading its description, the experiment continues to take data tirelessly and is poised to unveil more mysteries.

## RELICS Reactor Neutrino Experiment

Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a unique probe for neutrino properties beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent Scattering experiment ([RELICS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05554)), a proposed reactor neutrino program using liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXeTPC) technology, aims to investigate the CEvNS process of antineutrinos off xenon atomic nuclei. The experiment will be located at a baseline of 25m from a reactor core with 3GW thermal power in the Sanmen nuclear reactor in Sanmen, China.
